## Your Web Application Title

This website is an inventory manager that is linked to an individual's account. This means that every different account 
will have a different set of items associated with it.

- Goal: Create a website that allows a user to manage their company resources through the use of an inventory manager.
- Challenges: I had a lot of trouble with the authentication and it redirect routes.
- Authentication/Database: I used the local strategy because it seemed easier and a sqlite database because I had used sqlite
in the past on a Software Engineering project and was familiar with it
- CSS framework: Milligram because it was easy to work with
- Five Middleware Packages:
  -  Express-session: Creates a session for a particular user
  -  Passport: Allows for user authentication
  -  Body-parser: Makes dealing with JSON objects easier through some catch all methods
  -  flash: allows server to flash error messages
  -  favicon: server can create a favicon.ico that displays
  -  Sequelize: makes commands to a SQLite database easier

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used SQLite and the Sequelize framework over the suggested low-db

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I only used semantic HTML and did not utilize divs or spans
